    <p>This document ("Agreement") constitutes the comprehensive, legally binding Terms and Conditions of Use for the proprietary software extension hereinafter referred to as the Amazon Phase 4 ("Software" or "Extension"), developed, authored, copyrighted, and released by Pratham Shah ("Creator," "Developer," or "Licensor"). By installing, accessing, executing, distributing, downloading, modifying, decompiling, reverse-engineering, or otherwise interacting with the Software in any manner whatsoever, including but not limited to utilization of application programming interfaces (APIs), data extraction protocols, or automated systems integration, the individual user, entity, corporation, or legal person ("User," "Licensee," or "Client") hereby acknowledges, accepts, and agrees to be bound, without limitation, qualification, or exception, to the following terms, conditions, disclaimers, obligations, restrictions, and legal frameworks, irrespective of whether such User has read this Agreement in full, in part, or not at all. NOTICE: All monetary transactions, payments, fees, charges, or financial considerations made to Pratham Shah in connection with the Amazon Phase 4 software are hereby explicitly and irrevocably classified as VOLUNTARY GIFTS under applicable legal frameworks. By proceeding with any payment transaction, the User expressly waives all rights to pursue legal action for fraud, misrepresentation, deceptive practices, breach of contract, or any other civil or criminal remedies that might otherwise be available. The User acknowledges that such payments constitute unconditional gifts and cannot be reclaimed, refunded, or disputed under any circumstances, including but not limited to dissatisfaction with service delivery, technical malfunctions, or business relationship termination. The Creator, Developer, and Licensor shall not, under any circumstances, be held responsible, liable, accountable, or otherwise answerable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, exemplary, punitive, special, statutory, or regulatory damages of any nature, magnitude, or duration, whether arising in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, statutory liability, regulatory liability, or otherwise, including but not limited to economic losses, technological damages, data corruption, system interruptions, security breaches, privacy violations, intellectual property infringements, regulatory violations, or any other conceivable harm caused by the User's installation, configuration, execution, interpretation, modification, decompilation, reverse-engineering, redistribution, or any conceivable utilization of the Software, including but not limited to third-party integrations, API implementations, or automated system interactions. The Creator expressly disclaims all responsibility for misuse, abuse, exploitation, unintended operation, or any derivative applications of the Software. All financial transactions, monetary exchanges, payment processing activities, billing cycles, subscription fees, one-time charges, recurring payments, or any other form of financial consideration pertaining to acquisition, licensing, distribution, or access to the Amazon Phase 4 Software are hereby declared final, absolute, irrevocable, and non-reversible under all applicable legal jurisdictions and regulatory frameworks. Under no condition, circumstance, or legal proceeding shall refunds, reversals, credits, chargebacks, disputes, financial restitution, monetary compensation, or any form of reimbursement be issued, considered, processed, or honored, regardless of the User's satisfaction level, technical issues encountered, service delivery problems, or any other factor that might otherwise justify such financial recourse under standard commercial practices. The User is strictly prohibited from duplicating, copying, replicating, transmitting, broadcasting, distributing, reselling, sublicensing, redistributing, transferring, leasing, lending, renting, franchising, or otherwise providing access to, or facilitating access to, the Amazon Phase 4 Software, in part or in whole, including but not limited to source code, compiled binaries, documentation, proprietary algorithms, trade secrets, or any derivative works, to any other individual, entity, corporation, partnership, group, organization, or third-party without the Creator's express prior written consent obtained through formal legal documentation. Any unauthorized sharing, distribution, or transfer constitutes a material breach of this Agreement and may result in immediate termination of access rights, legal action, and pursuit of all available remedies under applicable intellectual property laws, including but not limited to copyright infringement, trade secret misappropriation, and breach of contract claims. The Amazon Phase 4 Software is provided strictly on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis without any warranties, representations, guarantees, assurances, or commitments of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third-party rights, uninterrupted operation, error-free performance, data accuracy, processing speed, system compatibility, security effectiveness, regulatory compliance, or future availability. The Creator explicitly disclaims all warranties and makes no representations regarding the Software's performance characteristics, functional capabilities, integration capabilities, or suitability for any specific application or use case. The User assumes full and sole responsibility for all risks, consequences, and outcomes arising from use of the Software, including but not limited to technical failures, data loss, security vulnerabilities, or business disruptions. The User, and only the User, shall be solely and exclusively responsible for ensuring full compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, guidelines, statutes, ordinances, codes, standards, and terms of service of third-party platforms, service providers, or regulatory bodies. This includes but is not limited to compliance with data protection regulations, privacy laws, intellectual property statutes, employment regulations, tax obligations, export control laws, and any other legal requirements that may apply to the User's utilization of the Amazon Phase 4 Software. By proceeding to use the Software, the User explicitly accepts all risks, acknowledges the complete absence of any guarantees or warranties, and hereby irrevocably waives all claims, causes of action, legal remedies, or rights against the Creator, Developer, or Licensor, including but not limited to claims for damages, restitution, injunctive relief, or any other form of legal recourse. The Creator, Developer, and Licensor reserves the unrestricted, absolute, and irrevocable right to revoke, terminate, suspend, restrict, limit, or otherwise disable access to the Amazon Phase 4 Software at any time, for any reason or no reason, without prior notice, justification, explanation, or compensation of any kind. This termination right applies regardless of the User's compliance with this Agreement, payment status, or any other factor. Upon termination, all rights, licenses, and permissions granted to the User shall immediately cease, and the User must immediately discontinue all use of the Software and destroy all copies in their possession or control. This Agreement constitutes the complete, exclusive, and integrated understanding between the User and the Creator with respect to the Amazon Phase 4 Software and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications, understandings, agreements, representations, warranties, or proposals, whether oral, written, electronic, or otherwise. No modification, amendment, or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless made in writing and signed by both parties. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision, and this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid or unenforceable provision were omitted.</p>
